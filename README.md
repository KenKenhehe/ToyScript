This is a simple math intepreter I build in C++, inspired by this video series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88lmIMHhYNs&amp;list=PLZQftyCk7_Sdu5BFaXB_jLeJ9C78si5_3&amp;index=1

Currently it supports:



Addition:
> 1 + 1 -> 2


Subtraction:
> 2 - 1 -> 1


Mutiply:
> 2 * 2 -> 4


Divide:
> 4 / 2 -> 2


Changing of order of operation:
> 1 + 2 * 2 -> 5
And
>(1 + 2) * 2 -> 6

Unary operation:
> -2 - 1 -> -3
And
> +3 + 1 -> 4

Power:
> 4 ^ 2 -> 16

Modulus:
> 4 % 2 -> 0
